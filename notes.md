Skills:
- Instead of a skill tree, you have an investment portfolio
- You are able to buy shares in a company, and apply those shares towards skills for the given company
- In game events trigger shifts in share price for the various companies
- Some, but not all of these skills will scale with the share price of the given company

Ammo and Grenade Charges:
- Ammo and grenade charges are always a fixed price, guns and grenades are balanced by how much ammo/charges they cost to use
- 

Shopping:
- Items can be purchased in stores
- For additional money non-unique items can be ordered and dropped off immediately by drone
- When ordering things, hidden surge pricing mechanics raise and lower the buy price for various, items (Amazon)
- There is also an E-bay equivalent where you can bid on items (Rarer items have a chance to appear here, but some common items can be bought as well and surge pricing does not effect)

Runes:
- Could be fun to design my own runes
- Would like them to not be just different elements
